**Steps to run the code on your device**
--------------------------------------
### 1. Download the dataset
You first need to download the ROOT data file: 16O_C2H4_200_01.root.

Then, move the ROOT File into your code folder, in which there is the Analysis_input. This latter contains the beam features (mass number, charge, kinetic energy in GeV) and 
the name of the ROOT file. 

Open Analysis_input, as notes, and check the ROOT data file name is right.
