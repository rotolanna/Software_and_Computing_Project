**General informations**

This folder contains all the informations related to the code and the results of the project itself.

1. **Project_00** : the basic structure of my code in C language. It's composed of the function main() and the first implemented functions in order to generate 
   a MonteCarlo simulation on a particle beam which passes through all the FOOT detectors. It gives the MC quantities related to the different particles (such as
   the "generated" momentum, kinetic enengy, betha, gamma etc..).

2. **Project_01** : a part of my thesis work in C/C++ language. It takes a set of input_data (Rootuple) and, through my Reconstruction_Class, 
   returns a series of plots on the reconstruction of the charge Z and on the identification of the mass number A of the particles. The FOOT experiment
   is based on measurements of A through three different methods.
   
3. **Mass Plot** : a power point with some results. Also, fit parameters are shown. 
4. **Z_reconstructed** : the charge reconstructed plot from the projectile fragmentation on target.
